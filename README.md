# MARVEL-Revamp
Revamp and update of collecting the MARVEL image classification dataset

The repository is simply downloaded using git clone and then use python to run the download.py script. Feel free to edit and fork, as this repo is quite bare bones but generally is meant to replicate the functionality of https://github.com/avaapm/marveldataset2016 from the publication "Gundogdu E., Solmaz B, Yucesoy V., Koc A., Marvel: A Large-Scale Image Dataset for Maritime Vessels, Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV), 2016". 

## To do
- [] Add class split
- [] Multi-threading
- [] Start stop download functionality
